# arm-project-2
Write an ARM program in ARMSim# that will do the following:

-Read the text from a file called "input.txt" as a string of characters\
-Uppercase every vowel\
-Replace all punctuation and symbols with an asterisk (*)\
-Output the new string from memory to a file called "output.txt"\
-For example:
>1."input.txt" contains "Hunting season if you will Tell me where’d you’d rather be I can hardly see the moon Hope we’ll get there pretty soon"\
>2."output.txt" should contain "HUntIng sEAsOn If yOU wIll TEll mE whErE*d yOU*d rAthEr bE I cAn hArdly sEE thE mOOn HOpE wE*ll gEt thErE prEtty sOOn"
Meeting the above requirements is a bare minimum for the assignment. In order to get full credit, your program should:

have appropriate comments (not too much and not too little)
check for and handle errors, such as a missing file or an empty file
have readable output (beyond the example) and/or error messages
Please submit a single file called "project2.s" to the assignment.
